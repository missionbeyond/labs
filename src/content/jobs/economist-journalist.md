### Who we're looking for

Brimming with ideas and keen to learn about every aspect of journalism, from written content to art direction, design, photography and social media

A record of academic achievement and evidence of strong critical thinking skills. 

### To apply 

- Log in to your Creative Access account or register today to apply for this opportunity 
- After clicking the 'apply' button, you will be directed to the application form

As part of your application – alongside a CV and cover letter – please write a short critique of the 1843 piece on a WhatsApp-driven kidnapping scare, outlining its strengths and weaknesses. Don’t be afraid of being harsh – we are our own sternest critics, and none of our pieces are perfect. 

Please also come up with three ideas for how we could turn news in the headlines into magazine pieces that tell the stories of individuals. For example, last year we ran a piece about one person’s experience working with an AI chatbot. 

If you are called for interview, we will also ask you to do a short fact-checking exercise. 

Below are a few recent 1843 stories that we’ve particularly enjoyed. The links below are free to read. You can read more 1843 content by registering with The Economist, which gives you access to five articles a month free. 

- The second world war turned Okinawa into a graveyard. Now it is in China’s sights. 
- Why have pregnant Russians flocked to Argentina since the invasion of Ukraine? 
- The last drag queens of Tennessee. 
- The mystery of Morocco’s missing king.
